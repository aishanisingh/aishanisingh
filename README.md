# aishani singh
Hi! I'm an (incoming) high school freshman who's interested in mostly STEM subjects, and occasionally writing.

## Projects
I don't really have any notable projects to mention here (although you can look at my repos and make that judgement for yourself), but I do have a [website](https://aishani-singh.github.io) that I coded which contains all of my important links you can visit. 

## Interests
Like I said, I'm very passionate about STEM subjects, particularly math and machine learning. I participate heavily in the AMC competitions (AMC8, AMC10, AIME) and other competitions here and there. I'm also learning machine learning, and you can see some of my basic models which I have created in my repositories.

## Contact
You can look at my main forms of contact on my website, but I respond quickly mostly through [Gmail](mailto:aishani.singh@gmail.com) and Discord (my tag is BlueLightning#5322).
